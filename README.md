# Generals IO Simulator
The goal of this is to have a convenient way of simulating the 
game of [Generals IO](http://generals.io/) offline.

I personally plan on using it to train some form of AI.

I'm attempting to utilize as much code from [vzhou842's](https://github.com/vzhou842)
original in js. I dont speak js, so Im re-writing it in python as Im a parser tongue.
